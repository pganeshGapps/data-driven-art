***If you are a programmer; not being a good artist (using your hands) should not stop you to be creative!***

Enjoying 'data-driven art' on weekends during lockdown.
I am using NLP & CV concepts along with standard data science practices.

If you want to collaborate or suggest me few things, let me know.

**Future Plans:**
1.  Extending all NLP programs/packages being used to non-english corpora.
2.  I am thinking of using deep unspervised learning in near future for more real-life appearances.
3.  Deep supervised learing for entity recognization.

**Contents:**
1.  'Word Cloud' for 'Face of Day' : Cloud containing keywords associated with FoD
